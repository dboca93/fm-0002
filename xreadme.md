# Product Preview Card Component


## Overview

I've built this card component preview 
by positioning the card with absolute in 
the middle of the page. 

Then I've used a media query to change 
the flex-direction within the container
so that it's flex-column. 

I've also used the website Vercel for the 
first time, which is a good application 
to post websites so that you can fully appreciate
the user-end experince. 

I used git-bash to push the code online. 

After finishing this readme-file, I will 
also add a more personalised attribution 
which will have my picture and will hopefully 
leave a better impression for people looking at 
all of my completed online mentor projects.
